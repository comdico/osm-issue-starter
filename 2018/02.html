        <p><span class="dropcap">L</span>et's swing a wrecking ball through today's tired ORs, clear the rubble, and rebuild with efficiency and improved patient care in mind. The popular redesign concept over the past 50 years has been to make rooms bigger, but that's not the way to go moving forward. I'm part of a joint research team that includes faculty from Clemson University and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). We're in the process of analyzing every aspect of the current operating room standard and reinventing the space from the ground up. Here are some of the design enhancements we came up with.</p>

        <p><span class="fancybullet blue-bg">1</span><strong> Improved situational awareness.</strong> Team members need to be informed of what's happening outside of their domains of care. We're examining the optimal placement of monitors, electronic medical record screens and equipment in order to improve each team member's line of sight to the sterile field and allow them to perform a majority of their work while facing the surgical field. I'm hopeful that smaller EMR interfaces will be able to be positioned in the anesthesia provider's line of site without blocking their view of the patient and I believe providers will someday interact with EMRs using gesture movements instead of keyboards.</p>

        <p><span class="fancybullet blue-bg">2</span><strong> Better communication.</strong> Patient monitors are typically placed at the head of the table, but current technology allows for projecting clinical data onto large plasma screens hung throughout the OR. Ultra high-definition video monitors feature touchscreen technology and are getting bigger, which allows for a tiled view of clinical data, radiology images and the laparoscopic or arthroscopic view of surgery. Integrated ORs help keep every member of surgical team informed and engaged in the case, no matter where they're working or watching from.</p>

        <p><span class="fancybullet blue-bg">3</span><strong> Room reconfiguration.</strong> The optimal size of an outpatient OR is about 600 square feet. Corners of the room become dead spaces when the table is placed in the center of the room, but angling the table and placing the anesthesia workstation in a corner frees up a tremendous amount of real estate at the foot of the table and along the right side of the room.</p>

        <!BREAK2!>

        <p><span class="fancybullet blue-bg">4</span> <strong>Future flexibility.</strong> We're trying to create standardized and versatile rooms that can be redesigned over time without having to pay for and endure multimillion dollar renovations. For example, booms can be hung from steel grids housed in ceilings. The booms would be stationary, but not permanent, and could be repositioned and fixed in different parts of a room in just a couple hours. If the steel grids are housed in a linear fashion above a series of standardized ORs, walls could be removed to expand the spaces and booms could be repositioned to accommodate larger technologies.</p>

        <p>Building ORs against outside walls lets architects incorporate plenty of natural light in their designs. It also means exterior walls can be knocked down at a relatively low cost if future expansion is needed. </p>

            <figcaption><strong class="blue-cap">READY AND WAITING</strong> Patients are prepped and sedated in a pair of induction rooms attached to each of the facility's 4 ORs.

          <h5 class="blue">Linear Pathway Optimizes Patient Flow</h5>
          <p>Seattle Children's Bellevue Clinic and Surgery Center in Bellevue, Wash., is a 4-OR facility that's part of an 80,000-square-foot multi-specialty clinic. The surgery center was specifically designed to move pediatric patients along the perioperative pathway quickly and comfortably.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;The big idea was to design the space for a very efficient linear flow,&rdquo; says Todd Johnson, vice president of facilities at Seattle Children's.</p>

          <p>Patients move from the waiting room into one of two induction rooms attached to each OR. A nurse and anesthesia provider prepare and sedate patients for surgery and then roll them on a stretcher table into the operating room.</p>

          <p>During surgery, another patient is brought into the twin induction room while the previously used induction space is being cleaned. The goal is to complete the procedure, pre-op induction and cleaning of the induction room in the same amount of time, so patients are constantly on the move.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;A lot of what we do is cans and strings,&rdquo; says Mr. Johnson. &ldquo;We started with optimizing patient flow and have begun to automate some of the steps.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Outfitting ORs with stainless steel modular walls means wall sections can be snapped out, repaired and replaced. Modular walls also allow for easy access to electric and gas lines for repair overnight or over a weekend. Installing modular walls might cost more up-front, but you might spend less on future repairs and renovations.</p>

        <h3 class="sanstitle">Bang for your buck</h3>

        <p>The typical surgical facility will remain operational for 15 to 20 years. You must build for today, but must also consider what will keep your facility relevant in a couple decades and do what you can now to minimize future renovation costs. A water wall in your lobby will wow patients and erecting an ultra-modern structure might earn you an architectural design award, but you'll get more bang for your building buck by investing in an OR that's ahead of its time. <strong class="osmblue">OSM</strong></p>
