          <p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur orthopedic practice was aware of the buzz surrounding outpatient spine &mdash; that better anesthetic techniques, minimally invasive approaches and improved pain management are making believers out of surgeons, patients and insurers &mdash; but it was the 600 spine cases our orthopods were performing at the local hospital each year that really got our attention. Why shouldn't our group manage all aspects of care and profit from the procedures? That's when we decided to build a surgery center set up for same-day spine and outpatient orthopedics.</p>

          <p>Early into our search for a new space, we found a 50,000-square-foot building that was centrally located to our other offices with off-highway access to serve the majority of our patient population. The former tenant was a major electronics distributor, so we have plenty of remodeling planned for our contractors. If all goes according to plan, we should have the facility up and running by early next year. I've helped surgical practices open surgery centers around the country before bringing my knowledge and expertise to this project. Here's my best advice for building a spine facility with clinical efficiencies and cost-effectiveness in mind.</p>

          <h3 class="header-spine blue"><span>1</span> Prepare to spend big</h3>

          <p>Opening a new spine center can be an expensive proposition. Our move to the new space will be unique because of the amount of renovations we have to do. We'll be opening 8 ORs and will also be moving to 23-hour status &mdash; meaning we'll need a lot of room for post-op recovery. When it's all said and done, the entire undertaking will run several million dollars.</p>

            <figure class="divbeginright">
              <img src="/guides/surgical-construction/2018/images/spine_one.jpg" alt="CAPITAL EXPENSE">
              <figcaption><strong class="blue-cap">CAPITAL EXPENSE</strong> CAPITAL EXPENSE The budget to purchase the specialized equipment needed to perform spine procedures could easily surpass $1 million.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

          <p>Considering the tools needed to do same-day spine safely and efficiently, you could spend well over $1 million just on equipment alone. Any center looking to outfit their ORs would need to invest in several key pieces of equipment &mdash; specialized spine tables, X-ray machines and anesthesia machines &mdash; each costing in excess of $100,000. Likewise, a new C-arm could cost $90,000 to $150,000 and a new surgical microscope will likely run you more than $100,000.</p>


          <p>Purchasing refurbished equipment remains one cost-trimming option, but you need to have confidence that your equipment will withstand the rigors of a high-volume facility. Aside from the large capital expenditures, you have to factor in the costs of the long list of other essentials, ranging from surgical supplies like multiple sets of power tools, light sources, spine instrumentation and patient-positioning equipment, to all the pre-op and post-op needs, such as vital signs monitors and patient beds, to sterile processing equipment like autoclaves and washers. The costs add up quickly.</p>

          <!BREAK2!>

          <p>Our group has found a balance by investing in new technology without going overboard. For example, we considered upgrading to 4K imaging in the new space, but when our surgeons compared the visualization of ultra-high definition with our existing high-definition cameras, they determined the difference did not warrant the required investment. My advice: Don't invest in new technology just because it's new. In truth, I like to monitor devices, tools and platforms that have been on the market for a while before deciding if there's a clear benefit to buying in.</p>

          <p>Lastly, because we'll also be doing total joints at the new facility, we needed to consider adding robotic surgical systems. Some of our surgeons currently perform robotics-assisted surgeries for the total joints cases they perform at the local hospital. One of those systems can cost upwards of $1 million, which is a sizeable investment, especially because there's no reimbursement attached to it. So, if we determine there's a legitimate need for one of those systems, we're going to have to look into adding it through a financing agreement.</p>

          <h3 class="header-spine blue"><span>2</span> Hire the right team </h3>

          <p>Partner with a good consultant to help design and plan your new center or you could find your project behind schedule by as much as a year. I suggest finding someone who works in the state in which you're breaking ground because every state's laws and building requirements are different. Working with a consultant who has a strong grasp of the financials is important, but I like partnering with a consultant who also has a nursing or clinical background because they will understand the challenges that go into the day-to-day management and operation of a surgical facility.</p>

          <p>You need to do your own homework, but a good consultant is the person who is tasked with helping you set everything up correctly the first time. They will know the rules and regulations for the state in which you're doing business; they will understand the implications of adhering to Medicare certification guidelines; and they will know the standards for whichever accrediting agency you choose to go with. The consultant's job is to help you set your center up right so there won't be any surprises.</p>

          <blockquote class="blue">Don't invest in new technology just because it's new.</blockquote>

          <p>Likewise, choose your architect carefully &mdash; preferably one that specializes in healthcare design. In addition, a builder who has worked on surgery centers and hospitals may be able to catch some of the Life Safety Code issues that a typical construction company might overlook. Deciding to go with commercial designers and builders increases the risk of making costly mistakes that end up being significant and expensive headaches.</p>

          <!BREAK3!>

          <h3 class="header-spine blue"><span>3</span> Focus on function first</h3>

          <p>Efficient patient flow is the most important thing; an inefficient design makes life much, much harder for your surgeons and staff. Our current ORs are standardized for general orthopedic cases. Having standardized room set-ups means our surgical team knows the equipment they need is always on hand and in the same spot. We'll use the same arrangement in the new facility and have built extra rooms near the ORs where spine-specific equipment such as C-arms and Jackson tables will be stored until needed. That smart storage solution will keep the ORs and corridors free of clutter.</p>

          <p>Build your facility to accommodate the number of cases you expect to host as soon as it opens, but also set aside space that you can grow into as case volumes continue to increase. In our new center, we're building 8 ORs, 2 of which will be 600 square feet &mdash; plenty of room for spine and total joints &mdash; and the other 6 will be the standard 400 square feet. We framed out 2 cells that can be turned into larger ORs if and when our spine volume increases. We also planned ahead and know where we'll put the extra recovery bays and additional waiting room space that more cases will require. <strong class="osmblue">OSM</strong></p>
