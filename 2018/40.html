          <dt class="blue bigger">Why are current ORs becoming antiquated?</dt>
          <dd>There hasn't yet been an in-depth analysis of how ORs can be redesigned to support current workflows and minimize safety hazards. Building bigger rooms isn't the solution &mdash; anesthesia providers and circulators can still feel confined in their workstations while many parts of the room go unused. Room layouts need to match how surgical team members actually behave in spaces.</dd>

          <dt class="blue bigger">What will the OR of the future look like?</dt>
          <dd>That's the million-dollar question. Procedures will become more minimally invasive and the technology needed to perform them will become more compact. ORs will likely be able to flex and change to accommodate new surgeries and surgical platforms. We anticipate building rooms with modular walls that can be modified as types of surgery and equipment continue to evolve. </dd>

          <dt class="blue bigger">What factors will influence future surgical designs?</dt>
          <dd>It's not all about adding new devices or gadgets. Building ORs that will be relevant demands a ground-level approach to truly understand the work that's done in spaces, and how surgical team members interact with each other and with emerging technologies. We need to create a standardized design centered on what will be needed in the next 10 to 20 years to improve how surgery is performed.</dd>

          <dt class="blue bigger">What will that forward-thinking design include?</dt>
          <dd>New designs for ambulatory surgery should be flexible and adaptable to accommodate changes in procedure types as well as technology and equipment that will be used. Increased standardization along with modular and plug-and-play designs will allow for a range of procedures and adaptations over time. Forward-thinking designs will include well-organized layouts that allow for efficient workflows. Any good OR design should also focus on reducing clutter and improving cleanability through material, storage and equipment selection.</dd>

          <dt class="blue bigger">Are new building projects intended to provide patient-centered care?</dt>
          <dd>There's certainly more of a focus on improving the overall patient experience from the waiting area to discharge, and the perioperative path is being designed to create a linear and more efficient flow. But new facilities are also being designed to improve how physicians and staff work and feel. We're looking at creating mobile nurse stations, so circulators can position themselves to have the best views of the sterile field. We also want to incorporate natural light into the OR. Nurses and surgeons often arrive in the dark during the early morning hours and leave in the evening after a long day of surgery. Working in a windowless room all day is unhealthy and we want to change that dynamic. <strong class="osmblue">OSM</strong></dd></dl>
